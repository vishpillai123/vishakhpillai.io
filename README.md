# My Github Projects

Hi! I'm Vish, an incoming Data Scientist/Analyst, and this is my repo and portfolio showcasing my school projects and notebooks. I recieved my Masters' in Information and Data Science (MIDS) from UC Berkeley and for the last three years, I've been working in Phoenix, AZ as a Yield Analysis Engineer at Intel Corporation. 

My hobbies and interests involve volunteering for the Citizens' Climate Lobby, learning music, and exploring new cuisines and cultures.
