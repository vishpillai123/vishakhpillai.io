# My Github Projects

Hi! I'm Vish, a Data Scientist at Intel Corporation. This portfolio showcases the work I completed in my Masters in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley. I  live and work remotely in New York City.

My hobbies and interests include volunteering for The City Tutors non-profit organization, playing jazz piano, and cooking plant-based recipes.
