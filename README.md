# My Github Projects

Hello, I'm Vish, a Data Scientist at Intel. My portfolio showcases the work I completed in my Masters in Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley.

Based in New York City, I spend my free time tutoring underserved populations and improving my skills in jazz piano. One of my passions is carrying on my family's legacy of cooking South-Indian cuisine while adapting the recipes to my plant-based diet.
