# My Github Projects

Hi! I'm Vish, a Data Scientist at Intel Corporation. This is my repo and portfolio showcasing my work from my Master's program, referred to as Master's in Information and Data Science (MIDS) from UC Berkeley. I currently live and work remotely in New York City.

My hobbies and interests involve volunteering for The City Tutors non-profit organization, learning music, and exploring new cuisines and cultures.
