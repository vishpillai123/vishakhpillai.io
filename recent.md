  Hello, I'm Vish, a Data Scientist at Intel. My portfolio showcases the work I completed in my Masters in Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley.
  <br><br>
  Based in New York City, I spend my free time tutoring underserved populations and improving my skills in jazz piano. One of my passions is carrying on my family's legacy of cooking South-Indian cuisine while adapting the recipes to my plant-based diet.

### Leopard Re-Identification
[Github](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/Animal_Identification) | <a href="https://www.leopardspotting.com/"> Website</a> | <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rc2KwmqQQ2cZCliXXOgD8idwS8myBuWY/view"> Paper</a> 

#### Problem Statement
Our project scope was to automate the tracking of animal populations and poaching in the wild. Utilizing deep learning techniques, we want to understand whether it is possible to achieve a manual survey accuracy (79%) for leopards. We will identify leopards based on distinctive features and flag untracked or out-of-distribution leopards in an unsupervised setting.
