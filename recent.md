#### Problem Statement
Our project scope was to automate the tracking of animal populations and poaching in the wild. Utilizing deep learning techniques, we want to understand whether it is possible to achieve a manual survey accuracy (79%) for leopards. We will identify leopards based on distinctive features and flag untracked or out-of-distribution leopards in an unsupervised setting.
