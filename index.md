### Leopard Re-Identification
[Github](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/Animal_Identification) | <a href="https://www.leopardspotting.com/"> Website</a> | <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rc2KwmqQQ2cZCliXXOgD8idwS8myBuWY/view"> Paper</a> 

#### Problem Statement
Project scope is to automate tracking animal populations and poaching in the wild. Utilizing deep learning techniques, we want to understand whether it is possible to achieve a manual survey accuracy (79%) for leopards. We will identify leopards based on distinctive features and flag untracked or out of distribution leopards in an unsupervised setting.

### Forest Cover Prediction
[Github]([https://github.com/vishpillai123/w207_final_project_bwp]) |  <a href="https://github.com/vishpillai123/w266_aes/blob/main/A%20Two-stage%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20for%20Automated%20Essay%20Scoring.pdf"> Presentation</a>

#### Problem Statement
Natural resource managers need to predict how climate change will affect the composition of tree communities and the functionality of ecosystems. Forest dynamics such as tree species, age composition, and other ecosystem attributes can be studied to understand environmental disturbances and management activities.  
Given a dataset of 15,120 training samples and 565,892 test samples, predict the forest cover type (out of 7 classes) for 30x30m2 sections of land based on 54 attributes (ex. elevation, area, soil type, distance to water, aspect, etc.).
