### Leopard Re-Identification
[Github](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/Animal_Identification) | <a href="https://www.leopardspotting.com/"> Website</a> | <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rc2KwmqQQ2cZCliXXOgD8idwS8myBuWY/view"> Paper</a> 

#### Problem Statement
Project scope is to automate tracking animal populations and poaching in the wild. Utilizing deep learning techniques, we want to understand whether it is possible to achieve a manual survey accuracy (79%) for leopards. We will identify leopards based on distinctive features and flag untracked or out of distribution leopards in an unsupervised setting.

### Automated Essay Scoring
[Github](https://github.com/vishpillai123/w266_aes) | <a href="https://github.com/vishpillai123/w266_aes/blob/main/A%20Two-stage%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20for%20Automated%20Essay%20Scoring.pdf"> Paper</a>

#### Problem Statement
Currently, the assessment of essays is extremely time consuming and expensive as teachers spend hours on grading essays individually. Automated essay scoring (AES) can help to increase time efficiency, while also reducing cost and potential grading biases.

Our project aims to develop AES by using BERT base and BERT-LSTM models to observe whether an RNN layer is needed for an effective two-stage learning framework.

### Forest Cover Prediction
[Github]([https://github.com/vishpillai123/w207_final_project_bwp]) |  <a href="https://github.com/vishpillai123/w266_aes/blob/main/A%20Two-stage%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20for%20Automated%20Essay%20Scoring.pdf"> Presentation</a>

#### Problem Statement
Natural resource managers need to predict how climate change will affect the composition of tree communities and the functionality of ecosystems. Forest dynamics such as tree species, age composition, and other ecosystem attributes can be studied to understand environmental disturbances and management activities.  

Given a dataset of 15,120 training samples and 565,892 test samples, predict the forest cover type (out of 7 classes) for 30x30m2 sections of land based on 54 attributes (ex. elevation, area, soil type, distance to water, aspect, etc.).

#### Problem Statement

In November 2020, our statistics team attempted to model and understand the spread of the global covid-19 pandemic. Utilizing a dataset of the 50 states in the US, we wanted to develop a regression outlining part of the causal chain of virus spread and casaulties. Though the correlation between cases and deaths was undeniable, the lack of data for ICU capacity, healthcare access, and general population health contributed to the difficulty of studying deaths. Thus, we developed a regression to outline the predictors for cases across the states.
